# GenAI NLP Tagging Pipeline using Longformer

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on fine-tuning Longformer and building custom NLP tagging pipelines for domain-specific mention analysis within the pharma and insurance industries. It includes tagging frameworks developed for Cipla, DRL (pharma competitors), and Tata AIA (insurance), integrating GenAI techniques to structure, classify, and analyze large text data efficiently.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Fine-tune Longformer for custom tagging and classification tasks  
- Preprocess unstructured competitor/brand data into structured training formats (JSON)  
- Automate entity tagging across multi-label datasets for pharma and insurance domains  
- Evaluate and visualize tagging accuracy using classification metrics

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python, Hugging Face Transformers, Longformer, Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter Notebooks

## 📁 Included Notebooks
1. `tata-aia-Longformer-train.ipynb`: Fine-tuning Longformer model for insurance-related tagging tasks  
2. `cipla-competitor-drl-json-creation-train-data.ipynb`: Creating structured training JSON from pharma raw text  
3. `CIPLA-Competitor-DRL-Final-Tagging-File.ipynb`: Final tagging execution and evaluation for competitor analysis

## 🚀 Outcomes
- Achieved 30–40% improvement in tagging scalability and processing time  
- Enabled automated domain-specific data labelling  
- Provided a reusable NLP framework for ORM and competitive intelligence projects

## 📎 Usage
